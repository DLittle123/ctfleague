%h1.home_h1 HEAVY METAL

%p.home_p Heavy Metal is a Capture the Flag team management simulation. You take the role of the commanding officer of a team, and must manage squad selection, soldier development, and injuries in order to conquer your enemies (a league full of teams managed by your friends).

%p.home_p Draft soldiers, select your starting squads for each match, and review their performance in simulated matches. Players improve with experience, but will leave if they think you arenâ€™t giving them enough playing time.

%h2 Can you lead your team to victory?
